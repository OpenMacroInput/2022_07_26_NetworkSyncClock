(Not code yet) This package allows to synchronise a DateTime computer in Unity to (&lt;1ms) on a clock online. The aim is to be able to trigger an action very precisely on several computer in Unity what ever the location or the atomic clock of the computer.


This package is a must have but I don't have code it yet.

I want use of OMI to be able to say I want on this computer to do an action at 16h30 (my time) but sync on this online clock.
And that if the code is executed in Americal, India or the computer this one. The action is execute all exactly at this time.

Lot's of use to this tool. 
But the main reason is to be able to make sync test in video game for video game tester and allows them to test bug that can only happened on precise timing in multiplayer.
